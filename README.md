# Employee Directory

## Description

In this project, I used a combination of React and a random employee API to generate a website that shows a directory of employees. The user is given the opportunity to search employees by first or last name, and also sort employees by first name, last name, age, or location. 

## Table of Contents

## Usage
 
To use, scroll the website to view the list of employees. Use the drop down feature to sort employees by name, age, or location. Users can also manually search in the input field by first or last name.

## UserStory

As a user, I want to see a list of employees so that when I search their name, the results are filtered appropriately.
As a user, I want to see a list of employees so that when I click on the appropriate category from the dropdown, the results are sorted by the respective value.

## Motivation

The motivation for my project was to create an employee directory that responds to user input searches and user action as it pertains to sorting by category.
